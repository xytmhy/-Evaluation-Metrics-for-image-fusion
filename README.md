# Evaluation-Metrics-for-image-fusion
In MATLAB

These four evaluation metrics are widely used in multi-focus image fusion.
After several days, I will also put the links of related papers.

We also include **Lytro dataset** here, if it is used in your research, you might have to include the original paper.
